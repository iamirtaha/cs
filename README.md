The Number-to-Letter Converter is a straightforward Python program designed to take numerical input and convert it into its corresponding letter representation. The program accepts integers as input and translates them into their alphabetical equivalent based on the English alphabet. This serves as a basic tool for understanding the relationship between numbers and letters.

How it Works:

The user is prompted to enter a numerical value.
The program checks if the input is a valid integer.
If the input is a valid integer, the program converts it into the corresponding letter, considering the English alphabet. For example, 1 is converted to 'A', 2 to 'B', and so on.
The result is displayed to the user.
for example
Enter a number: 7
The corresponding letter is: seven
This program helps users explore the relationship between numbers and letters, providing a simple and interactive way to understand basic programming concepts, input validation, and ASCII character encoding
